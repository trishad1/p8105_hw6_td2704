    ## #   ppwt <dbl>, smoken <dbl>, wtgain <dbl>

Above, birthweight\_data is a cleaned version of the original data with
columns babysex, frace, and mrace turned into factors and column malform
turned into a logical (“absent” = “0”/FALSE, “present” = “1”/TRUE).

``` r
colnames(birthweight_data)[colSums(is.na(birthweight_data)) > 0] 
```

    ## character(0)

This line above shows that none of the columns have missing values.

Propose a regression model for birthweight.

My hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight:  
babysex - difference in average birthweight by sex,  
blength - larger length = larger birthweight,  
fincome - higher income = healthier food = larger birthweight,  
malform - weight-related malformations,  
wtgain - mother’s weight gain could be correlated,  
gaweeks - gestational age could be correlated

So my linear model will take into account these factors as individual
variables to see which variables have the highest correlation.

``` r
fit = lm(bwt ~ babysex + blength + fincome + malform + wtgain + gaweeks, data = birthweight_data)

fit %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

Show a plot of model residuals against fitted values – use
add\_predictions and add\_residuals in making this plot.

``` r
birthweight_data %>%
  modelr::add_predictions(fit) %>%
  modelr::add_residuals(fit) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Model residuals vs fitted values of birthweight")
```

Let’s compare the above model to the following:  
(1) One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only).  
(2) One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
(including the three-way interaction) between these.

Create cross validation pairs dataframes.

``` r
cv_df =
  crossv_mc(birthweight_data, 100) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble))
```

Now, we fit to train data and get prediction errors (RMSE) for the test
data.

``` r
cv_df = 
  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    my_mod = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ babysex + blength + fincome + malform + wtgain + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    suggested_mod1 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    suggested_mod2 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data = .x))) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_my = map2_dbl(my_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_suggested1 = map2_dbl(suggested_mod1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_suggested2 = map2_dbl(suggested_mod2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))
```

Now we plot RMSE prediction errors across all 3 models to compare.

``` r
cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin() +
  ggtitle("RMSE Prediction Errors vs Model")
```

![](p8105_hw6_td2704_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

The above plot shows RMSE prediction errors on the test data for each of
the three models:  
“my” = babysex, blength, fincome, malform, wtgain, gaweeks (my
hypothesized model, main effects only)  
“suggested1” = length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only)  
“suggested2” = head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
(including the three-way interaction) between these

As we can see from the plot above, the second suggested model with all
interactions of head circumference, length, and sex had the lowest
prediction error. My hypothesized model has slightly lower error than
the first suggested model, but the second suggested model seems to be
the best model among the three for predicting birthweight.
